Assumptions:
I can create my own pattern for criteria to input:
IF CRITERIA DOESNT HAVE RULES IT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE MATCHED CRITERIA
SEARCH BAR ONLY FINDS BASED ON REFERENCE NUMBER
Rules#value is integer we assumes it only be used in integer fields


Missing:
Front end validation
Front End error messaging
VALIDATION FOR DEFAULT RULES FOR EACH CRITERIA
ADDED WEIGHTS TO EACH RULES but not used because lack of time


CAVEAT:
